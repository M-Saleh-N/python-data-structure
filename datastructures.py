"""
= They organize, store and manage data in ways that make your program more efficient, readable, and powerful.
= Diffrent problems need diffrent way to store and retrieve data.
= Lists are a great way for ordered collection you change .
= Tuples are like lists but immutable, perfect for mixed data.
= Dictionaries gives you fast access to data using keys.
= Using the right data structures makes your code faster.
= Looking up at an item in a dictionary is much faster thab a searching list

= A set is great when you want to remove duplicates.
= Well chosen data structures make code easier to understand
    e.g 
    instead of:-
            names = ["Tilak", "Ansh", "Esha"]
            ages = ["18", "18", "20"]
        We can do this:
            students = {"Tilak" : 18,"Ansh" : 18,"Esha" : 20}
